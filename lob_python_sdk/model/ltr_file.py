- For domestic destinations, the file limit is 60 pages single-sided or 120 pages double-sided. For international destinations, the file limit is 6 pages single-sided or 12 pages double-sided. PDFs that surpass the file limit will error, while HTML that renders more pages than the file limit will be trimmed.
- Any letters over 6 pages single-sided or 12 pages double-sided will be placed in a <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_flat_template.pdf" target="_blank">flat envelope</a> instead of the standard double window envelope.
