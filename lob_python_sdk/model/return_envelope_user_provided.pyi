    This class is auto generated by Konfig (https://konfigthis.com)

    Indicates if a return envelope is requested for the letter. The value corresponding to this field is by default a boolean. But if the account is signed up for custom return envelopes, the value is of type string and is `no_9_single_window` for a standard return envelope and a custom `return_envelope_id` for non-standard return envelopes.

To include a return envelope with your letter, set to `true` and specify the `perforated_page`. See <a href="https://www.lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare" target="_blank">pricing</a> for extra costs incurred.
